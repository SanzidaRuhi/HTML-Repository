 			Subject: Sick Leave Application format for Office

			Dear Mr/Mrs (name of recipient),

			I am writing this application to inform you that I am suffering from severe viral disease and therefore, I want sick leave from work. I got this infection last night and I will not be capable to come to the office for at least [number of days]. As advised by my doctor, I should take rest and recover appropriately before continuing work. The report from the doctor is also attached for your reference.

			Kindly grant me a leave for [number of days] days. I will be available on the phone in case of any emergency cases. Please reach me as per your comfort. For important matters, I have notified

			[Name of the colleague] to take care of them to assure that all deadlines are met.

			I believe you will understand and grant me leave for the mentioned period. I am waiting for your approval.

			Thanks for the consideration.

			Yours Sincerely
			(Name)
